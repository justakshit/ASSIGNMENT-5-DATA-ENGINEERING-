Copy Data from Database to CSV, Parquet, and Avro File Formats: Extract data from a relational database and export it into multiple file formats: CSV for broad compatibility, Parquet for efficient analytics, and Avro for schema evolution and compact serialization. These formats support various downstream use cases such as reporting, warehousing, or distributed data processing.

Configure Schedule Trigger and Event Triggers to Automate the Pipeline Process: Automate pipeline execution using schedule-based triggers for regular intervals and event-based triggers to respond to dynamic actions like file arrivals or database changes. This ensures timely and hands-free data movement in both real-time and batch scenarios.

Copy All Tables from One Database to Another: Perform full database replication by dynamically identifying and copying all tables and their data from the source database to the destination. This ensures complete schema and data consistency, aiding in backup, migration, or environment synchronization.

Copy Selective Tables with Selective Columns from One Database to Another: Enable selective data transfer by choosing specific tables and columns to move between databases. This approach supports compliance, reduces data volume, and aligns with business-specific requirements for targeted data migration.
